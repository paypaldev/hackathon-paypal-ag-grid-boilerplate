# PayPal SDK data pages

A Next.js app that reads sandbox data with the [PayPal TypeScript Server SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-TypeScript-Server-SDK) (`@paypal/paypal-server-sdk`) and shows it in simple tables.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 20.9 or later and a PayPal sandbox REST app ([developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/applications/sandbox)). The Transaction Search pages also need the app's **Transaction search** feature enabled.

```bash
npm install
cp env.example .env.local   # then fill in the values
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Next.js only loads the dotted `.env.local`; it is git-ignored, so credentials stay out of the repo.

Other scripts: `npm run build` (production build), `npm run start` (serve the build), `npm run lint`.

### AI assistant (optional)

The AG Studio dashboard at `/dashboard-api` has an AI assistant backed by OpenAI. The key is taken from the first of these that is set; with neither, the assistant is hidden:

1. `AG_STUDIO_OPENAI_API_KEY`, specific to this app. Put it in `.env.local` to choose the key for this demo.
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the name OpenAI's own tools use. If you already export one (e.g. in `~/.zshrc`), the demo uses it with no setup, and spends against it.

A separate name is needed because Next.js prefers variables already in the environment over `.env.local`, so a globally exported `OPENAI_API_KEY` can't be overridden per project. The server logs which variable it used (never the key) the first time the assistant is configured.

`OPENAI_MODELS` lists the model ids the assistant may use, comma-separated, first one the default (`gpt-5.4-mini` when unset); with two or more, the chat offers a model picker.

The key never reaches the browser. Studio's adapter ([`openai-adapter.ts`](app/dashboard-api/components/studio/ai/openai-adapter.ts), copied from the AG Studio docs) runs client-side and posts to this app's own [`/api/ai/responses`](app/api/ai/responses/route.ts), which adds the key, only allows the configured models, caps output tokens, and streams OpenAI's reply back.

In production `.env.local` isn't deployed: set the variable in your host's environment (e.g. Vercel project settings, `docker run --env-file`, or a secrets manager), as with the PayPal credentials. The route has no auth or rate limiting, so don't deploy it publicly with a real key without adding one.

## How it works

Every SDK call lives in [`lib/paypal.ts`](lib/paypal.ts), which owns the sandbox `Client`. Each page is a server component that calls one of those functions and renders the result with [`app/data-table.tsx`](app/data-table.tsx). Pages call `await connection()` so they render per request with live data instead of being prerendered at build time.

## Data pages

| Page | `lib/paypal.ts` function | SDK call | Shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`/transactions`](app/transactions/page.tsx) | `getRecentTransactions()` | `TransactionSearchController.searchTransactions` | First 20 transactions from the last 30 days |
| [`/subscriptions`](app/subscriptions/page.tsx) | `getBillingPlans()` | `SubscriptionsController.listBillingPlans` | First 20 subscription billing plans |
| [`/balances`](app/balances/page.tsx) | `getBalances()` | `TransactionSearchController.searchBalances` | Current balance per currency |

The examples below are real sandbox responses as the SDK returns them (camelCase fields, not the REST API's snake_case).

### `/transactions`

`searchTransactions({ startDate, endDate, fields: 'all', pageSize: 20 })` returns `transactionDetails[]`. Transaction Search accepts at most a 31-day range, and new activity can take up to three hours to appear. `fields: 'all'` adds `payerInfo` and the other sections; without it only `transactionInfo` is returned.

One `transactionDetails` item (a payout):

```json
{
  "transactionInfo": {
    "transactionId": "10890159B0554833L",
    "paypalReferenceId": "1FX78001X2681601H",
    "paypalReferenceIdType": "TXN",
    "transactionEventCode": "T0001",
    "transactionInitiationDate": "2026-09-23T12:11:56Z",
    "transactionUpdatedDate": "2026-09-23T12:11:56Z",
    "transactionAmount": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "-1.00" },
    "feeAmount": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "-0.25" },
    "transactionStatus": "P",
    "transactionSubject": "Probe payout",
    "transactionNote": "probe",
    "endingBalance": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "4997.50" },
    "availableBalance": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "4997.50" },
    "customField": "probe-1",
    "protectionEligibility": "02",
    "instrumentType": "PayPal",
    "instrumentSubType": "PayPal Wallet"
  },
  "payerInfo": {
    "emailAddress": "probe-receiver@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": { "countryCode": "1", "nationalNumber": "2028188144" },
    "addressStatus": "N",
    "payerName": {}
  },
  "shippingInfo": { "name": "John, Doe" },
  "cartInfo": {},
  "storeInfo": {},
  "auctionInfo": {},
  "incentiveInfo": {}
}
```

`transactionEventCode` is a [PayPal T-code](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/transaction-search/transaction-event-codes/) (`T0001` = payout). `transactionStatus` is `S` success, `P` pending, `D` denied, `V` reversed or `F` partially refunded.

### `/subscriptions`

`listBillingPlans({ pageSize: 20, prefer: 'return=representation' })` returns `plans[]`. The `prefer` header makes the list include `billingCycles` and `paymentPreferences`, which the default list response omits.

One `plans` item (a plan with a 30-day trial):

```json
{
  "id": "P-3RM52651TF551181NNKZ4BHQ",
  "productId": "AGGRID-CLOUD-STORAGE",
  "name": "Cloud Storage Basic (100 GB)",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "description": "Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage Basic (100 GB)",
  "billingCycles": [
    {
      "frequency": { "intervalUnit": "DAY", "intervalCount": 30 },
      "tenureType": "TRIAL",
      "sequence": 1,
      "totalCycles": 1
    },
    {
      "pricingScheme": {
        "version": 1,
        "fixedPrice": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "2.99" },
        "createTime": "2026-09-23T12:05:50Z",
        "updateTime": "2026-09-23T12:05:50Z"
      },
      "frequency": { "intervalUnit": "MONTH", "intervalCount": 1 },
      "tenureType": "REGULAR",
      "sequence": 2,
      "totalCycles": 0
    }
  ],
  "paymentPreferences": {
    "autoBillOutstanding": true,
    "setupFee": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "0.0" },
    "setupFeeFailureAction": "CONTINUE",
    "paymentFailureThreshold": 3
  },
  "quantitySupported": false,
  "createTime": "2026-09-23T12:05:50Z",
  "updateTime": "2026-09-23T12:05:50Z",
  "links": [
    {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/billing/plans/P-3RM52651TF551181NNKZ4BHQ",
      "rel": "self",
      "method": "GET"
    }
  ]
}
```

`totalCycles: 0` on the `REGULAR` cycle means the plan bills until cancelled.

### `/balances`

`searchBalances({})` returns the current balances. Pass `asOfTime` to get the balance at an earlier point in time.

```json
{
  "balances": [
    {
      "currency": "USD",
      "totalBalance": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "3537.71" },
      "availableBalance": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "3537.71" },
      "withheldBalance": { "currencyCode": "USD", "value": "0.00" }
    }
  ],
  "accountId": "QXJYHKET9Y4VC",
  "asOfTime": "2026-09-28T10:59:59Z",
  "lastRefreshTime": "2026-09-28T10:59:59Z"
}
```
